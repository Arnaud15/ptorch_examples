## Deep Learning examples in Pytorch
For now, we are getting started with ResNet re-implementations.

Check out a minimal demo on Google Colab: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fDUIkLjuU93LfLern0xHynnG4NWg-q7G?usp=sharing).

The current code in `models.py` is a re-implementation of the original ResNet [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385).


Next steps are implementing ideas from:
- The "Bag of tricks" [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01187)
- The "revisiting ResNets" [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07579)
